# ft_transcendence - Pong Game 42 Project

Playing video games is good. Programming them is better. But thenâ€¦ setting up tournaments is even better! With ft_transcendence, We will modernly recreate the 1979 classic Pong, integrate it into a website, and turn it into a competitive gaming platform. The website must be able to offer tournaments between players, so it has to manage registrations, victories, progression in rankings, and a chat. This ambitious project is the last project we must complete to be able to leave the core curriculum and access internships and fields of expertise.
